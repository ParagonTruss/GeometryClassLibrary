## Overview

Welcome to the Geometry Class Library. Built on the foundation of the [Unit Class Library](https://bitbucket.org/Clearspan/unit-class-library), the Geometry Class Library uses Distances to define geometric shapes.

Currently, the Geometry Class Library only supports shapes that have edges that intersect; circles and spheres and the like are not yet implemented.

To understand the impetus for this library, see the [Overview Page](https://bitbucket.org/Clearspan/geometry-class-library/wiki/Overview).

To understand the setup and components of the Geometry Class Library, see [Geometry Class Library Structure](https://bitbucket.org/Clearspan/geometry-class-library/wiki/Geometry%20Class%20Library%20Structure).
