# Welcome

Welcome to the Geometry Class Library. Built on the foundation of the [Unit Class Library](https://bitbucket.org/Clearspan/unit-class-library), the Geometry Class Library uses Dimensions to define geometric shapes.

Currently, the Geometry Class Library only supports shapes that have edges that intersect; circles and spheres and the like are not yet implemented.
